### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Akbar Bakhshi and I am a self-taught web and mobile developer based in the USA.

I got into web development in 2018 and finally switched from a Civil Engineering career to a full-time Web developer job in early 2022.

I love helping others like me who are transitioning into tech. That's why I have created two YouTube channles. If you are interested in Frontend Web development libraries, subscribe to my channel <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXTWhQiuHKOWV7HZJEInaNQ' aria-label='React Native Journey YouTube channel' target="_blank">here</a>. 

Don't forget to follow me on <a href='https://twitter.com/AkBakhshi' aria-label='Akbar bakhshi Twitter' target="_blank">Twitter</a> for tips and tricks related to web development and switching careers to tech.
